### APIs | Application Programming Interfaces
---

WHAT ARE APIs?
"An Application Programming Interface is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system"

1. We are going to create a newsletter signup using the MailChimp API

2. Newsletters are useful for keeping in touch we your subscribers, announcing product launches, or creating landing pages.

3. APIs allows us to interface with other peoples data. Great for creating widgets or components that generate dynamic data.

4. While using one API can be useful, using more than one opens a whole world of more possibilities.

5. Some are free some are paid, some are silly, while some are very important. So many types of APIs. # API-ApplicationProgrammingInterface
